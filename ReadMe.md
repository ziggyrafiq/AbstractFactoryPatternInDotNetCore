# AbstractFactoryPatternInDotNetCore

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Abstract Factory Design Pattern using .NET Core and C# 12. With the Abstract Factory pattern, families of related or dependent objects can be created without specifying their concrete classes, which ensures loose coupling and flexibility in software development.

## Components

- **AbstractFactory:** Defines methods for creating abstract products.
- **ConcreteFactoryA/B:** Implements the creation methods to produce concrete products.
- **AbstractProduct:** Interface for product types.
- **ConcreteProductA1/A2 & B1/B2:** Concrete implementations of abstract products.
- **Client:** Uses the abstract factory to create and use products.
